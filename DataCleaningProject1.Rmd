## This program contains code to clean up the MuseumArtsdata.
## The data is a collection of museum objects from the Metropolitan
## Museum of NewYork. The MetObjects.csv data file was downloaded from the 
## museum github account, https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess/. 
## Interested users can download the csv file of size 266 MB from the above 
## link. License information of this dataset is available in the LICENSE file.
 
## Including dply library for data wrangling 
```{r includelibs}
library(dplyr)
```

## Reading MuseumArtsData
```{r MuseumData}
# using read.csv file to read the data. 
# Sep is set to ",", as this is a comma delimited file. 
# Encoding = "UTF-8", as this is a UTF-8
# encoded data to include multilingual characters. 
# na.strings is set to "", NA to look for these NAs in the data.
MuseumData <- read.csv("./Data files/MuseumArtsData.csv", 
                       header = TRUE,
                       sep = ",",
                       encoding = "UTF-8",
                       na.strings = c("", NA)
                       )

# dim function is to display the dimension of the dataset
dim(MuseumData)
# str displays the structure of the dataset. One could identify
# the types of the variables/ columns
str(MuseumData)
```

## The MuseumData contains 474511 observations with 51 variables.
## These are the data of artworks currently available in the Museum.

## The str command displays the structure of the MuseumData. 
## Many factor variables in the dataset has NA/"" as a level.
## This indicates missing values in these factor columns.

## Issues presented in the website are:
## Missing values, inconsistent information, missing documentation,
## possible duplication, mixed text and numeric data

## The code identifies missing values in the dataset and removes
## some features completely. Some observations with NA values are
## omitted to do exploratory data analysis. After the cleaning process,
## the program performs exploratory data 
## analysis and provides some insights into the data. 

## The following section gives the definition of some feature columns.
## NOTE: This section will be expanded to include the definitions of
## all features.
## Object Number - The object number of the museum object is a factor 
## with 471721 levels. There are some duplicates but with different 
## unique object IDs. Since each unique object ID is associated with
## a Museum object, these cannot be removed by object number.

## Link Resource - This factor variable with 474511 unique levels matches the 
## number of rows in the dataset. This might be useful in the search for any object.

## Object ID - Object ID is an integer variable that identifies the rows uniquely.

## AccessionYear - This is an integer variable with Year information.

## Object Name - A Factor variable with some values in many languages.

## Object Date - A Factor variable with both strings and numbers as levels, such as 19th century, early 19th century, 1880s.

## Object Begin Date, Object End Date - These are integer variables with
## the object begin date and end dates in the Museum. Some negative dates
## and outliers were removed from the dataset.

## Department - Department provides upto 19 types of artworks, such as
## drawings and prints, european culture and decorative arts,
## Ancient near eastern art, Photographs, and Musical instruments.

## Artist.Begin.Date, Artist.End.Date  - These features are
## factors. These could be changed to date/integer types. Some negative ## ## 
## invalid numbers are present, which is removed as part of data cleaning.

## Artist Gender - is a factor with 276 levels and with more NAs. This will
## be cleaned up after finding the missingness percentage.

## The column names of the data is changed using names function.

## missingper function calculates the missing percentage of a row
## or column
```{r missingper}

# option = 2 and sort the resulting values.

```

## Based on the computed percentage of missing values per each feaure, we
## can decide to remove features with more than 5% missingness.

## AccessionYear is with only 0.86% missingness. 
## The variables Period, Dynasty, Reign, Portfolio, Subregion, Locale,
## Locus, Excavation, and River have above 81 - 100% missingness and have no data.
## These variables must be removed from the dataset before doing any
## analysis. Alternatively, information can be collected and added, if possible.

## The variables RightandReproduction, ObjectWikidataURL, 
## Region, State, County, ArtistGender, 
## and ArtistSuffix are also with high percentage (>95%) of missingness.

## Culture, ArtistRole, ArtistDisplayName, ArtistDisplayBio, ArtistAlphaSort,
## ArtistNationality, ArtistBeginDate, ArtistEndDate, ArtistULANURL,
## ArtistwikiURL, Tags, TagsAATURL - These variables have around 43% - 66%
## missing values.
